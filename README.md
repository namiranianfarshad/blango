# Blango - Advanced Django Coursera Specialization From Codio
Blango is a dynamic and evolving blog project created as part of the "Advanced Django" specialization from Codio on Coursera. The specialization spans four comprehensive courses, and this repository documents my progress up to the third course.

Throughout the courses, I'm learning how to build powerful web applications using Django and Django Rest Framework. blango, my blog creation, serves as a practical playground to implement the concepts and techniques taught in the courses.

## Technologies and Concepts Covered
- Django: A high-level Python web framework for rapid development.
- Django Rest Framework: A powerful toolkit for building Web APIs in Django applications.
- Python: The programming language powering the backend logic.
- HTML/CSS: Used for structuring and styling the blog's frontend.
- Git: Version control to manage project changes and history.

## Progress Status
I'm actively working on the project and implementing the knowledge gained from each course's lessons on the Codio platform. As I progress, I commit and push the new changes regularly to this repository.

## Goals
My primary goal with blango is to master Django and Django Rest Framework concepts while building a full functional blog. I plan to complete the entire "Advanced Django" specialization and continue to enhance this project beyond the course requirements.

## Learning Path
1. Improving Django proficiency through practical hands-on projects.
2. Gaining expertise in building and consuming RESTful APIs using Django Rest Framework.
3. Exploring advanced topics like authentication, permissions, and deployment.
